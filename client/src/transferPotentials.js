Secondly, \"gatekeeping\" occurs when some members of a group or community consider some others \"invalid\" as members of that community, and try to block them from accessing that community and its spaces. Examples include transmisogynists trying to remove transgender women from women's spaces, \"True Trans\" and transmedicalist transphobes trying to block non-dysphoric, non-binary, and/or gender non-conforming trans people from trans spaces, or LGT people trying to bar bisexuals, asexuals, etc, from LGBTQ+ spaces and communities.",

Not all LGBT+ people identify as queer and vice versa- I think they are two overlapping communities. I understand that some people are not comfortable being referred to as queer, but there are also some people with lesser known genders who dislike \"LGBT\" because of the large emphasis that community has historically put on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and (binary) Trans identities as opposed to less-known ones. Therefore, anyone should be able to talk about the \"LGBT+ community\" OR the \"queer community\" depending on whether they identify more as LGBT+ or queer, however there should always be the understanding that they don't speak for everyone.

        "definition": "A slang term, referring to often ignored or unspoken truths. Used to celebrate speaking up and acting out about oppression. One spills tea when expressing these truths, and one refers to the tea as being hot when agreeing with these truths. For example: Alice says, \"cops shouldn't march in uniform at Pride! The first Pride was a riot against police violence!\" Bob, upon considering Alice's statement, agrees and responds approvingly with, \"that tea is hot.\""

        "term": "gatekeeping",
        "definition": "The act of trying to limit access to queer community and identity to only acceptable groups, and exclude all others. In modern use, the acceptable groups are usually but not always lesbians, gay men, bisexual people attracted to or in relationships with people of their own gender(s), and dysphoric binary trans people. Gatekeeping often relies on historical revision and denial of the lived experiences of oppressed peoples. Popular targets for modern gatekeeping include questioning people, nonbinary people, and a-spec people, but all queer people other than healthy white gender conforming cisgender gay men attracted to other healthy white gender conforming cisgender men have been the targets of gatekeeping in the past, and any queer group may be the target of gatekeeping in the future."
