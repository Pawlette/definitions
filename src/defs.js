However, there are those of us who reject the term and who see it as a reminder of the hate and ignorance that surround us still.

Like sanction, which has two oposite meanings, I believe that both have their place. I love the vagueness of queer; it lets me tell others that I am a part of the LGBT umbrella without having to chose a more specific term.

I identified as agender for a few years, but I never felt right calling myself trans because I don't deal with sex dysphoria like those who need to medically transition do. That said, I've found that my experiences are very similar to those of (pre-transition) trans men save for my lack of sex dysphoria"
